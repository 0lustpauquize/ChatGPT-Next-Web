Anak was written by Ricky Lee and Raymond Lee, two of the most acclaimed screenwriters in Philippine cinema. They based the story on their own experiences and observations of Filipino migrant workers and their families. They wanted to show the realities and hardships of overseas Filipino workers (OFWs), as well as the social and psychological effects of their absence on their children. They also wanted to portray the complex relationship between a mother and a daughter, and how they cope with their differences and misunderstandings.
 
Anak was produced by Star Cinema, one of the leading film studios in the Philippines. It was part of Star Cinema's 7th anniversary celebration, and it was one of their most ambitious and expensive projects at the time. It had a budget of 40 million pesos (about 800,000 US dollars), and it was shot in various locations in Hong Kong and Manila. It featured a star-studded cast, led by Vilma Santos, one of the most respected and awarded actresses in Philippine cinema. She played the role of Josie, a role that she initially turned down because she felt that it was too similar to her previous roles. However, she changed her mind after reading the script and meeting with the director and writers. She said that she was challenged by the role, and that she wanted to give justice to the plight of OFWs.
 
Anak was released on May 10, 2000 in Philippine cinemas. It was a huge box office hit, earning over 160 million pesos (about 3.2 million US dollars) in its theatrical run. It was also well-received by critics, who praised its realistic and poignant story, its excellent direction and cinematography, and its superb performances by the cast, especially Santos and Barretto. It was nominated for 14 awards at the 2000 Metro Manila Film Festival, winning four, including Best Picture. It also won several awards from other award-giving bodies, such as the FAMAS Awards, the Gawad Urian Awards, the Star Awards for Movies, and the Young Critics Circle Awards.
